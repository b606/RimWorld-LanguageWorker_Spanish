[h2]Optimisation of Spanish languages in RimWorld[/h2]

This mod improves the grammar and typography rules specific to the target language in RimWorld, which are impossible to implement without modifying the C# code built in the game. It is a complement to the translators work at https://github.com/Ludeon/, until the patches that it introduces will be obsoleted by some future version of RimWorld.

This mod does not add more translation, so you need to get your language translation as complete and as updated as possible. Spanish and Latin America Spanish are supported.
		
The mod is also designed to be as independent as possible and does not require any modification or special annotations in the official translation. It should not theoretically interfere with any other mods, it should work on any saved game, and can be activated or deactivated at will. 

Please check out the features list and feel free to submit suggestions and bug reports on https://github.com/b606/RimWorld-LanguageWorker_Spanish/.

The above image is temporary, I am looking for better artwork to illustrate the mod and Spanish culture (submit your proposal :-)
